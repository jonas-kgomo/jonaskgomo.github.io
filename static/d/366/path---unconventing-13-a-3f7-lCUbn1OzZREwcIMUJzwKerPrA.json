Computational biology is an emerging discipline\nthat generally refers to two overlapping fields: 1) the practice of taking everything we’ve learned\nabout how to build computers and applying that knowledge to building cells as a programmable,\nflexible, platform with which we can do useful work, and 2) productizing and automating the\ntools, processes, and methods we use in the lab to manipulate biology and build living systems.\nAlthough we’ve gone through a few waves of “biotech bubbles” over the past twenty years, this\ntime may no longer only be about wildly speculative drug development, but instead about\nsomething more concrete and foundational. We'll be able to establish biological systems as\nengineered, all-purpose platforms that we can put to work the same way we do with computers.\nAdditionally, within a few years, we’ll reach a convergence point where our recent advances will\nstart to overlap, and eventually blend, into our existing computing frameworks and\ninfrastructure. This will have a profound and disruptive effect on many fields such as drug design\nand discovery, drug delivery, precision diagnostics and healthcare, engineered materials,\necology, agriculture, and much more. We’ll be able to work with biology in ways that\nincreasingly resemble the way we work with software: as a platform for building tools,\napplications, and infrastructure. This time, however, we’ll be able to do it using living systems\ninstead of code.</p>\n<p>Social Capital </p>\n<p>Digital machines generally beat cells for information processing jobs that demand precision and efficiency. But for jobs that require redundancy, adaptability and resilience in the face of the unknown?

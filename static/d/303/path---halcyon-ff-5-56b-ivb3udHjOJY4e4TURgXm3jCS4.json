It is conjectured that no NP-hard problem can be tractably computed by quantum computation.</p>\n<p>The amoeba solving the TSP NP-hard problem is a beautiful and shocking example of this principles described in this snippet. </p>\n<p>It is expected that no NP-hard problem is tractably computable by quantum computer. </p>\n<h2>NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf</a></p>\n<p>(see quote tweet for more details).\nAt this  moment I would like to echoe the deep ethos by Social Capital</p>\n<p> there are\na lot of hard problems in the world that computers cannot solve, but that biology can.\nFor many of these problems, the highest-potential path to fixing them lies in the overlap of\ncomputers and biology: computational biology. Computational biology is an emerging discipline\nthat generally refers to two overlapping fields: 1) the practice of taking everything we’ve learned\nabout how to build computers and applying that knowledge to building cells as a programmable,\nflexible, platform with which we can do useful work, and 2) productizing and automating the\ntools, processes, and methods we use in the lab to manipulate biology and build living systems.\nAlthough we’ve gone through a few waves of “biotech bubbles” over the past twenty years, this\ntime may no longer only be about wildly speculative drug development, but instead about\nsomething more concrete and foundational. We'll be able to establish biological systems as\nengineered, all-purpose platforms that we can put to work the same way we do with computers.\nAdditionally, within a few years, we’ll reach a convergence point where our recent advances will\nstart to overlap, and eventually blend, into our existing computing frameworks and\ninfrastructure. This will have a profound and disruptive effect on many fields such as drug design\nand discovery, drug delivery, precision diagnostics and healthcare, engineered materials,\necology, agriculture, and much more. We’ll be able to work with biology in ways that\nincreasingly resemble the way we work with software: as a platform for building tools,\napplications, and infrastructure. This time, however, we’ll be able to do it using living systems\ninstead of code.</p>\n<p>Social Capital </p>\n<p>Digital machines generally beat cells for information processing jobs that demand precision and efficiency. But for jobs that require redundancy, adaptability and resilience in the face of the unknown? Living systems ftw. </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/halcyon","title":"Biological Informatics","date":"2014-03-23"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/halcyon/"}}

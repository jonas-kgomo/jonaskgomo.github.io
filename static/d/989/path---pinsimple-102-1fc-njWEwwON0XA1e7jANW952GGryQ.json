It is casual to share files like videos, audio and text over the internet. However , there is no standard for sharing 3D objects,audio or text files combined with specific interaction.</div>\n<p>Mixed reality product marketplace means a lot of sharing capabilities will be explored. CGI (<strong>computer-generated imagery</strong>) sharing will enable ergonomically sustainable usage for the affordance for personas (users). A way to enable zero-sum game is an interaction in which some combinations of actions provide a net gain or loss to the two of them.</p>\n<h2><p style=\"color: darkgrey\"> How will we interact with reality?</p></h2>\n<p>Although this might seem like a simple question, I think  its answer is as deep as its simplicity. From a spatial computing point of view it is dependant on the input, from an information point of view it is dependent on the channel. From a theoretical physics point of view it is dependent on the universe, and constraints from a mathematical point of view. From a biological view we have a mutisensory organism capable of manifold inputs.</p>\n<h3>Digital Dualism</h3>\n<p>Nathan Jurgenson is a sociologist and social media theorist at Snapchat.\nHis perspective rejects the digital dualist position that the digital and physical are separate spheres and instead promotes the idea that atoms and bits enmesh to create our augmented reality. \nAs Thiel would say, we've seen \"innovation in the world of bits, but not in the world of atoms.\"</p>\n<h3>Shopify</h3>\n<p>How do you send a digital vinyl record to your friend and allow them to play it remotely on ther device, moreover , what do we even call that interaction file we just sent? What do we call catching Pokemons when they are something else, what does catching mean? These are the motivations for going through a list of shareable methods for interaction design</p>\n<iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/PlasticSophisticatedGoa' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='640' height='404'></iframe><p> <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/plasticsophisticatedgoa-shopify-webvr\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Microformats</h1>\n<p>The question above can technically be posed as : \n\"What is a review or event? What are the specific fields in the data structure?\"\nMicroformat lets both user and machine understand and answer these questions equivocally. A  web of data sources, services for exploring and manipulating data, and ways that users can connect them together.

These were designed to exchange source art assets in the content pipeline of a film studio. They are fantastic for that use case, but they were never designed for the needs of real-time client-side rendering applications like Apple is promoting it for.\nSafari on iOS 12 supports viewing 3D models and allows you to see them in Augmented Reality (AR). Supported assets use the Universal Scene Description format, or USDZ, developed by Pixar. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gLTF 2.0</h2>\n<p>glTF™ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications.\nglTf is the current best practice for runtime delivery formats.\nPBR-based materials, glTF 2.0 is a stable base for the future and will support practical runtime implementations for many graphics APIs. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Features include: Graphics API neutral,  Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material definitions <em>(Material information stored in textures)</em>, Deployment as single file <em>(Binary glTF )</em>, Morph Targets <em>(enhanced animation system)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Windows Mixed Reality</h2>\n<p>WMR is a mixed reality platform introduced as part of the Windows 10 operating system, which provides holographic and mixed reality experiences with compatible head-mounted displays</p>\n<h2>SFA</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sceneform assets are assets that are encoded insides Google's Sceneforms API. They store information about the model. They work inside android studio for ARCore.  For runtime, you can use the SFB, which is the binary for SFA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Point-Clouds</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A point cloud is a set of data points in some coordinate system <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb R^3</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">R</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141079999999999em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> . The PLY file format defines vertices and (polygon) faces. This means the intersection(s) between a plane and the polygons defined in a PLY file are polylines (or polygons).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>In the desire to summarise these interaction, we have classified three levels of interaction: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Hard Caustic  |  Soft Caustics |   Augmented Caustics</h3>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>1. Hard Caustic(Haustics)</h2>\n<p>These are hard surfaces in the physical world that can recieve signals from the real world to the digital. Interaction in this case is designed as a Natural User Interface. So a keyboard falls under this class, here is the most general and ubitiquous model. In a more general sense we have a detached surface that responses to gestures. One example of this is <a href=\"https://www.hypersurfaces.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hypersurfaces</a>, this includes a series of modular UI that is embedded as IoT and/or sensors.  Ofcourse, we consider non-locality <em>( spooky action-at-a-distance)</em> as a subject falling under this class.</p>\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/295596170\" width=\"640\" height=\"268\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>This method is purely based on haptics as an input.</p>\n<h2>2. Soft Caustics (Saustics)</h2>\n<p>This is hardware designed to help interact within a software.In the WAVE VR application these soft caustics are known as waves. Input is usually limited to the electromagnetic spectrum radiation,hardware(joysticks,knucles .etc).</p>\n<h4>Soli</h4>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"268\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QNiZfSsPc0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nSoli is a Google project using  RADAR as a base technology for sensing microgestures. Its chip transmits a millimetre-wave radar electromagnetic waves of wavelength  1mm $\\to$ 10mm which are longer than infrared rays and x-rays but, smaller compared to radiowaves and microwaves.\n<p>Hardware that can interact with software as a shareable.</p>\n<h4>Leap Motion</h4>\n<p>These track infrared light with a wavelength of 850 nanometers, which is outside the visible light spectrum. The data takes the form of a grayscale stereo image of the near-infrared light spectrum, separated into the left and right cameras. Typically, the only objects you’ll see are those directly illuminated by the Leap Motion Controller’s LEDs.  Algorithms from this sensor are not depth-mapping but computer vision oriented.</p>\n<h2>3. Augmented Caustics (Augstics)</h2>\n<p>Veemo controlling a drone with an AR mobile app.\nApproaches that span gesture tracking, motion tracking, eye tracking, and speech are evolving</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Shannon</h2>\n<h3>Information Entropy</h3>\n<p>In 1948, Claude Shannon, a young engineer and mathematician working at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, published \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication,\" a seminal paper that marked the birth of information theory. In that paper, Shannon defined what <strong>\"information\"</strong> meant for communication engineers and proposed a precise way to quantify it-in his theory, the fundamental unit of information is the bit.</p>\n<div style=\"background:#D4D3D3; padding: 10px; margin: 40px; box-shadow: 0 6px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2)\"> \nHe also showed how data could be \"compressed\" before transmission and how virtually error-free communication could be achieved. The concepts Shannon developed in his paper are at the heart of today's digital information technology. CDs, DVDs, cell phones, fax machines, modems, computer networks, hard drives, memory chips, encryption schemes, MP3 music, optical communication, high-definition television-all these things embody many of Shannon's ideas.\nWhat he showed is you can communicate reliably even though the communication medium is unreliable; that's what digital means.\n</div>\n<p>Shannon’s limit is often referred to as channel capacity.32\n<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>B</mi><mtext>  </mtext><mi>l</mi><mi>o</mi><msub><mi>g</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mrow><mo fence=\"true\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mi>S</mi><mi>N</mi></mfrac><mo fence=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mtext>  </mtext><mtext>  </mtext><mtext>  </mtext><mtext>  </mtext><mtext>  </mtext><mtext>  </mtext><mtext>  </mtext><mtext>  </mtext><mtext>  </mtext><mtext>  </mtext><mo>→</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">C = B \\;

What that means is I could send my voice to you today as a wave, or I could send it to you as a symbol. What he showed is if I send it to you as a symbol, for a linear increase in the resource used to represent the symbol, there is an exponential reduction in the error of you getting the symbol correctly as long as the noise is below a threshold. If the noise is above the threshold, you're doomed. If it's below a threshold, a linear increase in the symbol gives you an exponential reduction in error.</p>\n<h3>Entropy</h3>\n<div style=\"background:#D4D3D3; display:flex; padding: 10px; margin: 40px; box-shadow: 0 6px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2)\"> \n<img src=\"https://i.redd.it/7ek2amf1s0rz.png\" alt=\"billinfo\" style=\"width:50%; height: 50%\">\n<p style=\"display:inline; margin: 12px; font-size:18px; color: blue\"> Bill Gates showing information equaivalence of a log of paper sheets&#xA0;\n&quot;This CD-ROM can hold more information than all the paper that&apos;s here below me&quot;\n- Bill Gates,1994. \n<br>\n<br>\nShot in 1994 for  a National Geographic story called the Information Revolution.

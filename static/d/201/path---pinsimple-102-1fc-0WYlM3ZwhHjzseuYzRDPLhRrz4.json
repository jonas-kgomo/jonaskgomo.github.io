It is casual to share files like videos, audio and text over the internet. However , there is no standard for sharing 3D objects, audio or text files combined with specific interaction.</p>\n<p>Mixed reality product marketplace means a lot of sharing capabilities will be explored. CGI (<strong>computer-generated imagery</strong>) sharing will enable ergonomically sustainable usage for the affordance for personas (users). A way to enable zero-sum game is an interaction in which some combinations of actions provide a net gain or loss to the two of them.</p>\n<p>How do you send a digital vinyl record to your friend and allow them to play it remotely on ther device, moreover , what do we even call that interaction file we just sent? What do we call catching Pokemons when they are something else, what does catching mean? These are the motivations for going through a list of shareable methods for interaction design</p>\n<h2>In this series we ask the question, what shall we call the meriad of 3D shareable assets in digital realities ?</h2>\n<h1>AR Cloud</h1>\n<p>There are three major components of the AR Cloud:</p>\n<li >A scalable and shareable machine readable representation of the world aligned with real world coordinates . It could for instance be implemented with point-clouds.</li>\n<li> The ability to instantly localize (align the world’s soft-copy with the world itself) from anywhere and on multi devices</li>\n<li> The ability to place virtual content in the world’s soft-copy and interact with it in realtime, on-device and remotely\n</li>","frontmatter":{"path":"/pinsimple","title":"Caustic Shareables","date":"2018-12-23"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/pinsimple/"}}

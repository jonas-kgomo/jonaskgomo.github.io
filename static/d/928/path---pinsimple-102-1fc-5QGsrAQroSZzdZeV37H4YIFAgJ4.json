{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1>Shareable Caustics</h1>\n<p> Shareable Caustics is a class of interactive methods for objects in mixed reality. It is casual to share files like videos, audio and text over the internet. However , there is no standard for sharing 3D objects, audio or text files combined with specific interaction.</p>\n<p>Mixed reality product marketplace means a lot of sharing capabilities will be explored. CGI (<strong>computer-generated imagery</strong>) sharing will enable ergonomically sustainable usage for the affordance for personas (users). A way to enable zero-sum game is an interaction in which some combinations of actions provide a net gain or loss to the two of them.</p>\n<h3>Shopify</h3>\n<iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/PlasticSophisticatedGoa' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='640' height='404'></iframe><p> <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/plasticsophisticatedgoa-shopify-webvr\"></a></p>\n<p>How do you send a digital vinyl record to your friend and allow them to play it remotely on ther device, moreover , what do we even call that interaction file we just sent? What do we call catching Pokemons when they are something else, what does catching mean? These are the motivations for going through a list of shareable methods for interaction design</p>\n<h2>Microformats</h2>\n<p>The question above can technically be posed as : \n\"What is a review or event? What are the specific fields in the data structure?\"\nMicroformat lets both user and machine understand and answer these questions equivocally. A  web of data sources, services for exploring and manipulating data, and ways that users can connect them together.

[2] : 1 Rather than analyzing how things are, interaction design synthesizes and imagines things as they could be. This element of interaction design is what characterizes IxD as a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field</p>\n<p> The Soli Sensor, being developed as part of a project of Google Advanced Technology and Projects group, is a low-power radar designed to use less energy and detect hand gestures on a sub-millimeter level. It operates in the 60-GHz ISM band using electromagnetic waves. The sensor detects a series of motions that are part of Soli's Virtual Tools Gestures: virtual slider, virtual button and even virtual button. The pluses for the chip are that it requires less energy, has no moving parts, can function regardless of the light conditions, and when developed further in the future, could be used in a number of products: wearables, IoT devices, phones and cars.</p>\n<p> Ivan Poupyrev, Poject Soli founder, said about the goal of the project, \"The hand is the ultimate input device. How could we take this incredible capability, the finesse of human actions and the finesse of using our hand but apply it to the virtual world?\"</p>\n<h2>In this series we ask the question, what shall we call the meriad of 3D shareable assets in digital realities ?</h2>\n<h1>AR Cloud</h1>\n<p>There are three major components of the AR Cloud:</p>\n<li >A scalable and shareable machine readable representation of the world aligned with real world coordinates .

It is casual to share files like videos, audio and text over the internet. However , there is no standard for sharing 3D objects, audio or text files combined with specific interaction.</p>\n<p>Mixed reality product marketplace means a lot of sharing capabilities will be explored. CGI (<strong>computer-generated imagery</strong>) sharing will enable ergonomically sustainable usage for the affordance for personas (users). A way to enable zero-sum game is an interaction in which some combinations of actions provide a net gain or loss to the two of them.</p>\n<h2>Digital Dualism</h2>\n<p>Nathan Jurgenson is a sociologist and social media theorist at Snapchat.\nThis perspective rejects the digital dualist position that the digital and physical are separate spheres and instead promotes the idea that atoms and bits enmesh to create our augmented reality. \nAs Thiel would say, we've seen \"innovation in the world of bits, but not in the world of atoms.\"\nNeil Gershenfeld, director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms</p>\n<h3>Entropy</h3>\n<p>Bill Gates showing information equaivalence of a log of paper sheets </p>\n<p>nui(pronounced \"newey\"), as shorthand for \"natural user interface,\" arguing that the term was used only \"inside the Microsoft bubble.\"\n\"What I'd like to say is 'biorealistic,' \" Lanier said, adding, opaquely, \"I think that's really addressing the human nervous system on its own terms.\"\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@ryanhickman/augmented-reality-robotics-bb6db40ab754\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://medium.com/@ryanhickman/augmented-reality-robotics-bb6db40ab754</a>\nThe argument that the Dysons do address is a secondary one in my mind; to what degree messiness limits or enhances the future of software. The key question here is whether different kinds of unreliability are effectively interchangeabled. George Dyson equates the failure modes of primordial chemistry with failure modes seen in contemporary software. This shouldn't be understood as a comparison between hardware and software per se, but between elements whose connections can only be described by statistics, like molecules, or indeed physical gates in a computer, versus elements that connect by Platonic logic.\nCertainly the Dysons are correct to a degree, in the sense that error recovery algorithms can grant a \"soft knee\" to software failure modes that is reminiscent of the type of \"statistical binding\" seen in natural systems. Real computers as we know them are not built this way, of course. A thought experiment is different from a real-world viable machine.\nIn George Dyson's original posting, he said, \"It is that primordial soup of archaic subroutines … that is driving the push towards the sort of fault embracing template-based addressing that proved so successful in molecular biology\".</p>\n<h3>Shopify</h3>\n<iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/PlasticSophisticatedGoa' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='640' height='404'></iframe><p> <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/plasticsophisticatedgoa-shopify-webvr\"></a></p>\n<p>How do you send a digital vinyl record to your friend and allow them to play it remotely on ther device, moreover , what do we even call that interaction file we just sent?

What are the specific fields in the data structure?\"\nMicroformat lets both user and machine understand and answer these questions equivocally.

[2] : 1 Rather than analyzing how things are, interaction design synthesizes and imagines things as they could be. This element of interaction design is what characterizes IxD as a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field</p>\n<p> The Soli Sensor, being developed as part of a project of Google Advanced Technology and Projects group, is a low-power radar designed to use less energy and detect hand gestures on a sub-millimeter level. It operates in the 60-GHz ISM band using electromagnetic waves. The sensor detects a series of motions that are part of Soli's Virtual Tools Gestures: virtual slider, virtual button and even virtual button. The pluses for the chip are that it requires less energy, has no moving parts, can function regardless of the light conditions, and when developed further in the future, could be used in a number of products: wearables, IoT devices, phones and cars.</p>\n<h2>Shannon Information Theory</h2>\n<p>In 1948, Claude Shannon, a young engineer and mathematician working at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, published \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication,\" a seminal paper that marked the birth of information theory. In that paper, Shannon defined what the once fuzzy concept of \"information\" meant for communication engineers and proposed a precise way to quantify it-in his theory, the fundamental unit of information is the bit.</p>\n<p> Ivan Poupyrev, Poject Soli founder, said about the goal of the project, \"The hand is the ultimate input device. How could we take this incredible capability, the finesse of human actions and the finesse of using our hand but apply it to the virtual world?\"</p>\n<p>He also showed how data could be \"compressed\" before transmission and how virtually error-free communication could be achieved. The concepts Shannon developed in his paper are at the heart of today's digital information technology. CDs, DVDs, cell phones, fax machines, modems, computer networks, hard drives, memory chips, encryption schemes, MP3 music, optical communication, high-definition television-all these things embody many of Shannon's ideas\nWhat he showed is you can communicate reliably even though the communication medium is unreliable; that's what digital means.\nThe one that's most interesting for me is he proved the first threshold theorem. What that means is I could send my voice to you today as a wave, or I could send it to you as a symbol. What he showed is if I send it to you as a symbol, for a linear increase in the resource used to represent the symbol, there is an exponential reduction in the error of you getting the symbol correctly as long as the noise is below a threshold. If the noise is above the threshold, you're doomed. If it's below a threshold, a linear increase in the symbol gives you an exponential reduction in error.</p>\n<p>Thus the human body might be the most unreliable device but according to Von Neuman that doesnt stop it from being an excellent commucation .

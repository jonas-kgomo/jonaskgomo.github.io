Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor survives it. Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory - precession of simulacra - it is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map. It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges subsist here and there, in the deserts which are no longer those of the Empire, but our own. The desert of the real itself.</p>\n<p>In fact, even inverted, the fable is useless. Perhaps only the allegory of the Empire remains. For it is with the same imperialism that present-day simulators try to make the real, all the real, coincide with their simulation models. But it is no longer a question of either maps or territory. Something has disappeared: the sovereign difference between them that was the abstraction's charm. For it is the difference which forms the poetry of the map and the charm of the territory, the magic of the concept and the charm of the real. This representational imaginary, which both culminates in and is engulfed by the cartographer's mad project of an ideal coextensivity between the map and the territory, disappears with simulation, whose operation is nuclear and genetic, and no longer specular and discursive. With it goes all of metaphysics. No more mirror of being and appearances, of the real and its concept; no more imaginary coextensivity: rather, genetic miniaturization is the dimension of simulation. The real is produced from miniaturized units, from matrices, memory banks and command models - and with these it can be reproduced an indefinite number of times. It no longer has to be rational, since it is no longer measured against some ideal or negative instance. It is nothing more than operational. In fact, since it is no longer enveloped by an imaginary, it is no longer real at all. It is a hyperreal: the product of an irradiating synthesis of combinatory models in a hyperspace without atmosphere.</p>\n<p>In this passage to a space whose curvature is no longer that of the real, nor of truth, the age of simulation thus begins with a liquidation of all referentials - worse: by their art)ficial resurrection in systems of signs, which are a more ductile material than meaning, in that they lend themselves to all systems of equivalence, all binary oppositions and all combinatory algebra. It is no longer a question of imitation, nor of reduplication, nor even of parody. It is rather a question of substituting signs of the real for the real itself; that is, an operation to deter every real process by its operational double, a metastable, programmatic, perfect descriptive machine which provides all the signs of the real and short-circuits all its vicissitudes. Never again will the real have to be produced: this is the vital function of the model in a system of death, or rather of anticipated resurrection which no longer leaves any chance even in the event of death. A hyperreal henceforth sheltered from the imaginary, and from any distinction between the real and the imaginary, leaving room only for the orbital recurrence of models and the simulated generation of difference.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/simulacra","title":"Simulacra VR","date":"2014-03-23","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='400' height='250'%3e%3cpath d='M22 119c-1 0-3 3-4 7-2 6-2 10-3 43a897 897 0 0 1-3 68v13h213v-59c0-59 0-60 2-60s2 1 2 29v28h133v5h-60v2c0 2 0 2-1 1h-6c-5 0-6-1-4-3l-4-1h-5l3 1c5 2 5 3 1 3-3 0-4 0-4-2-1-3-3-3-4 0 0 2-1 2-5 2l-5-2h2l1-1h-9l2 1c3-1 3 0 3 1l-2 1h-9c-9 0-13-2-5-2l6-1-8-1-8 1v4l-1 5-1-5v-5h-10v58h159v-15l-1-19-2-26a265 265 0 0 0-4-67v-4H22m9 24c0 2 1 2 23 2 21 0 22 0 22-2s-1-2-22-2c-22 0-23 0-23 2m332-1v27h2c4 0 4-1 3-4-1-2-1-2 1-2s2 0 1-1c-1 0-2-1-1-2 0-2 0-3-2-4-2 0-2 0 0-1l2-1 3-1c2 0 1-1-2-1l-6-1 3-1 4-2h-4c-2 0-3 0-2-1l2-1h1l2-1v-1c-2-1-2-1 1-1 7 0 7-2-1-2l-7 1m-94 11a133 133 0 0 0 40 0l4 1 3-1c-1-2-47-2-47 0m-185 2c-6 0-7 0-7 2s0 2 16 2l18 1c1 1 0 1-3 1l-6 1 10 1c24 0 30 0 30-2h-1l-2-1 36-1c34 0 35 0 35-2v-2H84m186 6v2a828 828 0 0 0 57-2 255 255 0 0 0-43 0h-14m-19 19c-2 1 2 2 16 2l15-1h1l6 1h6l2-1c-1-2-17-2-21-1h-2a60 60 0 0 0-16 0h-7m-4 24a173 173 0 0 0 42 1c1 2 9 1 9-1 1-1-4-1-25-1l-26 1M31 214c0 2 1 2 23 2 21 0 22 0 22-2s-1-2-22-2c-22 0-23 0-23 2m76 0l5 1h5l27 1c27 0 28 0 28-3h-48l-17 1m32 4c-1 2 2 2 26 2 17 0 23-1 24-2l-6-1-6 1h-38m115 1l19 1c11 0 18 0 17-1l1-1 2 1h13c0-2-3-2-15-2l-12 1h-19c-3-1-6-1-6 1m0 9c0 1 3 2 19 1h22l3-1 2 1c1 0 2-2 0-2h-39c-2-1-7-1-7 1' fill='%2364ffda' fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.6,"src":"/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/2088e/halcyon.png","srcSet":"/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/7e01d/halcyon.png 200w,\n/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/f6494/halcyon.png 400w,\n/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/2088e/halcyon.png 800w,\n/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/3444c/halcyon.png 1200w,\n/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/c5878/halcyon.png 1280w","srcWebp":"/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/32a30/halcyon.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/6a338/halcyon.webp 200w,\n/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/bb49b/halcyon.webp 400w,\n/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/32a30/halcyon.webp 800w,\n/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/84367/halcyon.webp 1200w,\n/static/4660e57f6dc66a2170ee3d38632ecddf/0fb44/halcyon.webp 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/simulacra/"}}

Quantum computers haven't been obeying Moore's law. The reason is that to build quantum bits and put them together is a difficult process: You're operating at the most microscopic scale. It's tough to do. You have to control things very precisely.</p>\n<h2>Reversible Computing</h2>\n<p>This field hasn't recieved much attention , its like the climate change of computing, without the speculativism. </p>\n<p>It might not be a surprise that one of the most efficient computers we seek always wanted to have been in our presence and  has been here before we thought of creating one. </p>\n<p>To some extend, when you give a perfect machine a good proglem, it's no longer a problem but an input to its generic instruction set. For example , a matrix computes according to the linear operation provided to it. These type of machines are created to solve specific problems. </p>\n<h2>Phenotropic Computing</h2>\n<p>Biological systems have a function(<em>teliology</em>) and a dynamic.</p>\n<p>The amoeba is an analog computer that can ofcourse behave as a quantum system, since all physical systems ae quantum systems. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18735903\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18735903</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/IrisVanRooij/status/1079520922384695296\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/IrisVanRooij/status/1079520922384695296</a></p>\n<h2>What we learned from micro-organisms that solve intractable problems</h2>\n<p>This question is also relevant for issues of intractability in cognitive science.

Computational biology is an emerging discipline\nthat generally refers to two overlapping fields: 1) the practice of taking everything we’ve learned\nabout how to build computers and applying that knowledge to building cells as a programmable,\nflexible, platform with which we can do useful work, and 2) productizing and automating the\ntools, processes, and methods we use in the lab to manipulate biology and build living systems.\nAlthough we’ve gone through a few waves of “biotech bubbles” over the past twenty years, this\ntime may no longer only be about wildly speculative drug development, but instead about\nsomething more concrete and foundational. We'll be able to establish biological systems as\nengineered, all-purpose platforms that we can put to work the same way we do with computers.\nAdditionally, within a few years, we’ll reach a convergence point where our recent advances will\nstart to overlap, and eventually blend, into our existing computing frameworks and\ninfrastructure. This will have a profound and disruptive effect on many fields such as drug design\nand discovery, drug delivery, precision diagnostics and healthcare, engineered materials,\necology, agriculture, and much more. We’ll be able to work with biology in ways that\nincreasingly resemble the way we work with software: as a platform for building tools,\napplications, and infrastructure. This time, however, we’ll be able to do it using living systems\ninstead of code.</p>\n<p>Social Capital </p>\n<p>Digital machines generally beat cells for information processing jobs that demand precision and efficiency. But for jobs that require redundancy, adaptability and resilience in the face of the unknown? Living systems ftw. </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/halcyon","title":"Unconventional Computing","date":"2014-03-23"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/halcyon/"}}
